 Cod is a sandy peninsula created during the ice age that reaches out 
into the Atlantic Ocean like a crooked arm. Geologists are interested in
 Cape Cod because it was formed very recently in terms of geologic time 
and because of the ever-changing shore as the Cape adjusts to the rising
 sea. Because of its exposed location, many early explorers visited Cape
 Cod. The Wampanoag people lived here for thousands of years before the 
Europeans arrived, and were the Cape’s first true settlers.
<div class="clear"></div>
America’s history began along New England’s rugged shores. The Pilgrims 
first landed in America on the tip of lower Cape Cod. Here they found 
potable water and food and had their first fight with the natives. The 
Pilgrims, however, decided that this land was too sandy to support them,
 and they sailed across Cape Cod Bay to establish Plymouth.
<div class="clear"></div>
Over the next 20 years settlers spread north and south from Plymouth. 
The first parts of Cape Cod to be settled were the bay-side sections of 
Sandwich, Barnstable, and Yarmouth (all incorporated in 1639), along an 
old Indian trail that is now Route 6A. Most of the newcomers hunted, 
farmed, and fished; salt hay from the marshes was used to feed cattle 
and roof houses.
<div class="clear"></div>
Eventually, the settlers stripped the land of its forests to make 
farmland, graze sheep, and build more European-style homes, although 
with a New World look all their own. The steep-roof saltbox and the Cape
 Cod cottage – still the most popular style of house on the Cape and 
copied all over the country – were designed to accommodate growing 
families.
